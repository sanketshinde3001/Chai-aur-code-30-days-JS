// I . Variable Types Console Log: Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.


// Task 4: Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the typeof operator.

let variable1 = 5

let variable2 = "Text"

let variable3 = true

let variable4 = {
    id:6,
    name:"Sanket",
    isPassed:true
}

let variable5 = [1,2,3,4,5]

let variable6 = ["a","b","c","d"]

console.log("Data Type of Variable 1 - " + typeof variable1 + " and have value " + variable1)
console.log("Data Type of Variable 2 - " + typeof variable2 + " and have value " + variable2)
console.log("Data Type of Variable 3 - " + typeof variable3 + " and have value " + variable3)
console.log("Data Type of Variable 4 - " + typeof variable4 + " and have value " + variable4)
console.log("Data Type of Variable 5 - " + typeof variable5 + " and have value " + variable5)
console.log("Data Type of Variable 6 - " + typeof variable6 + " and have value " + variable6)
